    <h1 class="heading-13">The Problem</h1>
    <p class="paragraph-5">For many people in the US and globally, the pandemic has severely dampened philanthropy due to job loss, inflation, healthcare costs and increase taxes from government spending. The number of US households donating to charity is the lowest it has been in decades with less than half of family homes contributing in 2020. As a result, donors have developed mistrust towards traditional non-profit organisations who have difficulty displaying transparency of and allocating funds to the appropriate causes, <br><br>Contrary to this, DeFi protocols such as Olympus have seen immense periods of growth in relatively short amounts of time, and looking to introduce solutions to legacy problems. This has also had an impact on Olympus holders of staked OHM having increasing wealth due to the staking rewards, but have no way to redirect those rewards into worthwhile projects. In relation to this problem, many projects in the web3 space such as charities, OlympusDAO internal projects and new DAO ventures find it difficult to receive the funding they need. <br><br>Olympus Give has the opportunity to tackle the online philanthropy issue and promote community aid in DeFi. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="wf-section">
    <h1 class="heading-14">Research</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="paragraph-6">Prior to joining the project as a UX designer, much of the research had come from contributors from various parts of the DAO: Operations, Marketing, Engineering and Policy. These contributors have a deep understanding and experience of the economics of staking at Olympus,<br><br>Through this, research from their own experiences and those of the Olympus community found that many of these holders lost part of their investments or did not have options to redirect their yield other than themselves. </p>

    <h1 class="heading-15">Summary of Pain Points</h1>
    <p class="paragraph-7">• Many worthwhile projects find it difficult to receive the funding they need - including charities, OlympusDAO internal projects and new DAO ventures. <br>‍<br>• Holders of staked OHM have increasing wealth due to the staking rewards but have no way to redirect those rewards into worthwhile projects. <br><br>• The need for financial inclusion within the web3 environment and the world. <br><br>• Narrative and perception of crypto and DeFi being purely greed based with negative environmental consequences. </p>
    <h1 class="heading-16">Design Goal</h1>
    <p class="paragraph-8"><em class="italic-text">To build a system for lossless crowdfunding and yield redirection on top of Olympus.<br></em></p>
  </div>
  <h1 class="heading-17">Ideation</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-9"><strong>Crazy 8&#x27;s </strong><br><br>The initial contributors in the beginning of the Olympus Give project participated in a Crazy 8&#x27;s workshop, in which they brainstormed and explored the ideas for the product. Through card sorting and discussion, the key features they identified were through staking rewards:<br>‍<br>• Give contract will allow Ohmies to deposit sOHM to donate rebase yields to anyone without losing their principal. <br>• Donation recipients will be issued vault shares.<br>• sOHM inside contract will accumulate rebases.<br>• Recipients must redeem their shares for the deposited sOHM. <br>• Donors will be able to withdraw their principal deposited sOHM at any time.<br><br><strong>User Flow <br><br></strong>Upon joining the project with my co-lead designer, we explored the way in which the user would interact with the Olympus Give UI on the existing Olympus platform.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-14"><strong>Low-Fidelity Sketching <br><br></strong>The project team ran a sketching workshop for the project managers, engineers and designers to draw up ideas for how they would imagine the Olympus Give UI to look like. I incorporated the user flow in exploring what the dashboard, cause profile page, donation modal and confirmation screen would look like as first hand ideas. </p>

  <p class="paragraph-16"><strong>High-Fidelity Prototypes<br><br></strong>The UI designer of the project created the mid-fidelity prototypes of the initial sketches and wireframes as it would be on the existing Olympus platform. He included the branding and envisioning of the product on the desktop version. He also made multiple options for each screen in the user flow, in which a few have been included as examples underneath. Note: the confirmation state was explored further in the final designs. </p>

  <h1 class="heading-18">Validation</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-10">The project manager gathered a focus group of 12 Olympus users from the community to test the functionality of the prototype. Users were asked split up into two cohort teams to test the functionality of the &#x27;Give&#x27; and &#x27;Redeem&#x27;. They were tasked to use test tokens from the Rinkeby network to use on the test platform and fill a feedback questionnaire on their experience, <br><br>Through this it seemed that some issues that users found was in the &#x27;Give Yield&#x27; and &#x27;Redeem&#x27; functions itself in which they had difficulty navigating or confirming their actions in these states. <br><br>The project team also had input in the prototype designs, noting feedback regarding the statistics that are shown on the cause profile page. </p>
  <h1 class="heading-19">Iteration</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-11">Key changes that were decided between myself and the UI designer on the project made for the final designs included: <br><br>• Donations section on the cause profile page showing the donors and beneficiaries.<br>• Number to show the dollar fiat amount of how much sOHM has been donated to the cause in relation to the total donation goal.<br>• Changes to icons for the statistical information. <br>• Removal of activity section on the cause profile page.<br>• Additional of confirmation modal for the Give Yield flow.<br>• Mid-fidelity prototypes for mobile screens.</p>
  <h1 class="heading-20">The Solution</h1>
  <div class="section-17 wf-section"><img src="../images/web-platform.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/web-platform-p-500.png 500w, ../images/web-platform-p-800.png 800w, ../images/web-platform-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/web-platform-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/web-platform-p-2000.png 2000w, ../images/web-platform-p-2600.png 2600w, ../images/web-platform.png 2656w" alt=""><img src="../images/mobile-platform-give.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, (max-width: 3200px) 83vw, 2656px" srcset="../images/mobile-platform-give-p-500.png 500w, ../images/mobile-platform-give-p-800.png 800w, ../images/mobile-platform-give-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/mobile-platform-give-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/mobile-platform-give-p-2000.png 2000w, ../images/mobile-platform-give-p-2600.png 2600w, ../images/mobile-platform-give.png 2656w" alt="" class="image-11"></div>
  <p class="paragraph-12">Olympus Give provides stakers a way to make a meaningful impact in the world by donating their portion of their rebases. <br><br>Donors input their sOHM into the protocol, making a donation with each epoch every eight hours. They are also able to withdraw the original principle of their donation ay any time, enabling lossless donations. Olympus does not take any fee from selected partners so 100% of the donations go directly to the wallet of choice. <br><br>Redeem allows organisations or people who are the beneficiaries of Olympus Give to be able to claim their rebases. This unlocks a lot of potential to time campaigns in alignment with significant dates or events to the beneficiary. </p>
  <h1 class="heading-21">Conclusion</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-13">Being a UX designer of Olympus Give, I was able to gain experience in working in a DAO for the first time. I realised that as with the nature of the fast-paced space of DeFi that the ways of working within the multidisciplinary project team, that communication with my co-designer and the engineers were key to the launch of the product. <br><br>I also found that it was hard to enable the &#x27;traditional&#x27; user experience process and found we weren&#x27;t able to go in as much depth with the user research as much I would like to, which is something I would like to implement for future iterations. <br><br>As a learning process for myself with DAOs and DeFi, it was valuable to have people on the team who had a deep understanding of the economics of Olympus which assisted us with our designs. </p>
