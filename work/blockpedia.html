  <h1 class="heading-23">The Problem</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-18">For users in the blockchain, from beginner to advanced, learning the space can prove to be complex given the many terms which exist. When reading into articles, learning from courses and engaging with social media alike, users often find it hard to fully grasp key concepts in blockchain due to the amount of technical words being used. <br><br>Whilst there are many learning resources online for users interested in the blockchain space, it is difficult to find a concise but thorough blockchain term glossary which exists. Users are constantly wanting to locate this in a way which is accessible, succinct and organised, so that at any point in their educational journey in blockchain and web3 that they have a reliable source to go to. </p>
  <div class="wf-section">
    <h1 class="heading-24">Research</h1>
    <p class="paragraph-19">I conducted user interviews with four blockchain and web3 users who have varying levels of confidence with learning and understanding blockchain terminology. I asked them what platforms they used to start learning about blockchain, as well as the ones they currently use and are most effective for them.<br><br>Twitter (mobile) seemed to be the most popular resource to start learning and using more in relation to blockchain and web3. Most users also said that they do not feel as confident with understanding these and found most decentralized finance terms the most challenging to comprehend.</p>
  </div>
  <h1 class="heading-25">Summary of Pain Points</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-20">• Often times there&#x27;s a lack of documentation that&#x27;s explained in a really non-technical manner. <br><br>• Difficult to find and dedicate the time to sit down and actually learn all the blockchain terms. <br><br>• Finding these definitions are scattered across platforms and hard to locate in one place. <br><br>• It can be hard to remember and retain these terms for later. </p>
  <h1 class="heading-26">Design Goal</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-21">Enable users to access and develop their knowledge of blockchain terminology through an immersive and engaging learning experience. </p>
  <h1 class="heading-27">Ideation</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-22"><strong>Sketching<br>‍</strong><br>I explored the main states that users would go through the mobile application in order to identify the key features. Sketching these screens helped me ideate the layout as the fundamental screens. </p>
  <div class="section-11 wf-section"><img src="../images/blockpedia-sketching.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 80vw, (max-width: 2636px) 65vw, 1714px" srcset="../images/blockpedia-sketching-p-500.png 500w, ../images/blockpedia-sketching-p-800.png 800w, ../images/blockpedia-sketching-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/blockpedia-sketching.png 1714w" alt="" class="image-7"></div>
  <p class="paragraph-30"><span class="text-span-21">Wireframes<br><br></span>I was able to gauge the aspect ratios and layout of the application through wireframes in order to form a solid foundation for the high-fidelity prototype. <span class="text-span-21"></span>‍</p>
  <div class="section-12 wf-section"><img src="../images/blockpedia-wireframing.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 80vw, (max-width: 2612px) 64vw, 1672px" srcset="../images/blockpedia-wireframing-p-500.png 500w, ../images/blockpedia-wireframing-p-800.png 800w, ../images/blockpedia-wireframing-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/blockpedia-wireframing-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/blockpedia-wireframing.png 1672w" alt="" class="image-9"></div>
  <p class="paragraph-31"><span class="text-span-22">High Fidelity Prototype</span><br><br>Creating the high fidelity prototype helped me to get at a stage where the application was able to be reviewed for usability testing. Here I was able to gain a better and visual understanding of the functionality and branding of the application.</p>
  <div class="section-13 wf-section"><img src="../images/hifi-prototype.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 96vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 80vw, (max-width: 2420px) 79vw, 1912px" srcset="../images/hifi-prototype-p-500.png 500w, ../images/hifi-prototype-p-800.png 800w, ../images/hifi-prototype-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/hifi-prototype-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/hifi-prototype.png 1912w" alt="" class="image-10"></div>
  <h1 class="heading-28">Validation</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-23">I gathered a focus group of six users to test the high-fidelity prototype - all who had different experiences of learning blockchain terminology. My goal with the focus group was to see if users could effectively and easily search terms, navigate the application and if they found the quiz feature intuitive, I also wanted to ensure that the application in terms of visuals was readable and appealing to the users. <br><br>Key frustrations which I found from the testing were:<br>• 5 out of 6 users cited that for the category pages to have an option to view the definition for the title itself eg. Decentralized Finance. <br>• 4 out of 6 users felt there were inconsistencies with the look of the application - especially on the home and quiz pages.<br>• 4 out of 6 users wanted the definition to be able to fit on one screen, and not need to scroll too much. <br></p>
  <h1 class="heading-29">Iteration</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-24">Key changes that were made for the final design as influenced by the focus group testing were as follows: <br>‍<br>• Ensuring visual consistencies through using drop shadows for all screens. <br>• Adding in a pop-out icon on the title of the category page to ensure there is an option for users to go the definition page. <br>• Optimised the layout on the definition page, including the icon and font sizes and overall layout ratio to ensure it fits on one screen. </p>
  <h1 class="heading-30">Final Design</h1>
  <div class="section-14 wf-section"><img src="../images/final-design.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, (max-width: 3200px) 83vw, 2656px" srcset="../images/final-design-p-500.png 500w, ../images/final-design-p-800.png 800w, ../images/final-design-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/final-design-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/final-design-p-2000.png 2000w, ../images/final-design.png 2656w" alt=""></div>
  <p class="paragraph-25">Blockpedia allows avid blockchain learners to access a wealth of terminology on the go. With a simplistic and engaging interface, users are able to navigate through categories of blockchain terminology such as cryptocurrency (projects eg. Ethereum), DAO, DeFi, NFT and more. This makes it easier for users to access category specific terminology and develop a holistic understanding of blockchain. <br><br>In learning definitions, users are given the opportunity to learn examples in understanding the context of how terms are used as well as related resources for them to read more into topics. As an added level of playfulness and gamification, users can test themselves on definitions to ensure understanding and retention which aligns to their progress in the application. </p>
  <h1 class="heading-31">Conclusion</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-26">Working on Blockpedia has emphasised to me the continued importance of having users throughout the design process. In interviewing them in the research stage I was able to gauge understanding of their comfortability and confidence with learning blockchain terms as well as the platforms they use. <br><br>Through the ideation process itself, having a structure of going from sketching to high-fidelity prototypes allowed me to fully explore my initial ideas and see them come to life through each stage, providing clarity to its functionality and aesthetics. </p>
